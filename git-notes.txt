- It interacts with other systems like issue trackers and continous delivery pipelines.
Hosted options:
Github
big buket
- No working tree for a remote repo
- Remote repository ends with.git
if you already have local repository than do git remote add otherwise create a repo in git hub and clone it to local.

Creating a git repository
1)Create a repo folder (this represents the folder which will contain all the local repositories)
2)Create a myProj a single repository
3)run git init to initialize this as git workingtree and .git file is generated.
